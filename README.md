# UCDdle Solver
## Introduction
This small piece of code is far from optimal, it is an absolute mess of spagetti code not fit for any reasonable usuage, however, we move.

This is as much an endevour into finally learning Python and Bash as it is a way to not have to think while doing UCDdle

I highly reccomend checking out the project that inspired this @ https://UCDdle.tk

Its a great idea and really well executed and formated.

## Requirements
* Some form of GNU/Linux distro (or whatever you can make work, you probably know more than me lol)
* Python3
* git (for those cloning repo)

## Installation
For those using git:
```
git clone https://github.com/tomm-g/UCDdleSolver.git
cd UCDdleSolver
chmod +x UCDdleSolver.sh
```
For non git users:
* Download zip from repo
* Navigate to folder of your choosing where you downloaded zip
* Extract zip
* In terminal, make .sh file executable using command: ``` chmod +x UCDdleSolver.sh```

## Usage
Code can be executed by:
``` 
./UCDdleSolver.sh
```

This will return the answer to the daily UCDdle in plain text (in early versions output might be a bit messy)
